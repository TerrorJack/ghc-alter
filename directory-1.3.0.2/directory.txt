-- | Platform-agnostic library for filesystem operations
--   
--   This library provides a basic set of operations for manipulating files
--   and directories in a portable way.
@package directory
@version 1.3.0.2


-- | System-independent interface to directory manipulation.
module System.Directory

-- | <tt><a>createDirectory</a> dir</tt> creates a new directory
--   <tt>dir</tt> which is initially empty, or as near to empty as the
--   operating system allows.
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>isPermissionError</a> / <tt>PermissionDenied</tt> The process
--   has insufficient privileges to perform the operation. <tt>[EROFS,
--   EACCES]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>isAlreadyExistsError</a> / <tt>AlreadyExists</tt> The operand
--   refers to a directory that already exists. <tt> [EEXIST]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>HardwareFault</tt> A physical I/O error has occurred.
--   <tt>[EIO]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>InvalidArgument</tt> The operand is not a valid directory
--   name. <tt>[ENAMETOOLONG, ELOOP]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>NoSuchThing</tt> There is no path to the directory.
--   <tt>[ENOENT, ENOTDIR]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>ResourceExhausted</tt> Insufficient resources (virtual memory,
--   process file descriptors, physical disk space, etc.) are available to
--   perform the operation. <tt>[EDQUOT, ENOSPC, ENOMEM, EMLINK]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>InappropriateType</a> The path refers to an existing
--   non-directory object. <tt>[EEXIST]</tt></li>
--   </ul>
createDirectory :: FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt><a>createDirectoryIfMissing</a> parents dir</tt> creates a new
--   directory <tt>dir</tt> if it doesn't exist. If the first argument is
--   <a>True</a> the function will also create all parent directories if
--   they are missing.
createDirectoryIfMissing :: Bool -> FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt><a>removeDirectory</a> dir</tt> removes an existing directory
--   <i>dir</i>. The implementation may specify additional constraints
--   which must be satisfied before a directory can be removed (e.g. the
--   directory has to be empty, or may not be in use by other processes).
--   It is not legal for an implementation to partially remove a directory
--   unless the entire directory is removed. A conformant implementation
--   need not support directory removal in all situations (e.g. removal of
--   the root directory).
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><tt>HardwareFault</tt> A physical I/O error has occurred.
--   <tt>[EIO]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>InvalidArgument</tt> The operand is not a valid directory
--   name. <tt>[ENAMETOOLONG, ELOOP]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>isDoesNotExistError</a> / <tt>NoSuchThing</tt> The directory
--   does not exist. <tt>[ENOENT, ENOTDIR]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>isPermissionError</a> / <tt>PermissionDenied</tt> The process
--   has insufficient privileges to perform the operation. <tt>[EROFS,
--   EACCES, EPERM]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>UnsatisfiedConstraints</tt> Implementation-dependent
--   constraints are not satisfied. <tt>[EBUSY, ENOTEMPTY,
--   EEXIST]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The implementation does not support
--   removal in this situation. <tt>[EINVAL]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>InappropriateType</a> The operand refers to an existing
--   non-directory object. <tt>[ENOTDIR]</tt></li>
--   </ul>
removeDirectory :: FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt><a>removeDirectoryRecursive</a> dir</tt> removes an existing
--   directory <i>dir</i> together with its contents and subdirectories.
--   Within this directory, symbolic links are removed without affecting
--   their targets.
--   
--   On Windows, the operation fails if <i>dir</i> is a directory symbolic
--   link.
removeDirectoryRecursive :: FilePath -> IO ()

-- | Removes a file or directory at <i>path</i> together with its contents
--   and subdirectories. Symbolic links are removed without affecting their
--   targets. If the path does not exist, nothing happens.
--   
--   Unlike other removal functions, this function will also attempt to
--   delete files marked as read-only or otherwise made unremovable due to
--   permissions. As a result, if the removal is incomplete, the
--   permissions or attributes on the remaining files may be altered. If
--   there are hard links in the directory, then permissions on all related
--   hard links may be altered.
--   
--   If an entry within the directory vanishes while
--   <tt>removePathForcibly</tt> is running, it is silently ignored.
--   
--   If an exception occurs while removing an entry,
--   <tt>removePathForcibly</tt> will still try to remove as many entries
--   as it can before failing with an exception. The first exception that
--   it encountered is re-thrown.
removePathForcibly :: FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt><a>renameDirectory</a> old new</tt> changes the name of an
--   existing directory from <i>old</i> to <i>new</i>. If the <i>new</i>
--   directory already exists, it is atomically replaced by the <i>old</i>
--   directory. If the <i>new</i> directory is neither the <i>old</i>
--   directory nor an alias of the <i>old</i> directory, it is removed as
--   if by <a>removeDirectory</a>. A conformant implementation need not
--   support renaming directories in all situations (e.g. renaming to an
--   existing directory, or across different physical devices), but the
--   constraints must be documented.
--   
--   On Win32 platforms, <tt>renameDirectory</tt> fails if the <i>new</i>
--   directory already exists.
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><tt>HardwareFault</tt> A physical I/O error has occurred.
--   <tt>[EIO]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>InvalidArgument</tt> Either operand is not a valid directory
--   name. <tt>[ENAMETOOLONG, ELOOP]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>isDoesNotExistError</a> / <tt>NoSuchThing</tt> The original
--   directory does not exist, or there is no path to the target.
--   <tt>[ENOENT, ENOTDIR]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>isPermissionError</a> / <tt>PermissionDenied</tt> The process
--   has insufficient privileges to perform the operation. <tt>[EROFS,

--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The implementation does not support
--   renaming in this situation. <tt>[EINVAL, EXDEV]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>InappropriateType</a> Either path refers to an existing
--   non-directory object. <tt>[ENOTDIR, EISDIR]</tt></li>
--   </ul>
renameDirectory :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt><a>listDirectory</a> dir</tt> returns a list of <i>all</i> entries
--   in <i>dir</i> without the special entries (<tt>.</tt> and
--   <tt>..</tt>).
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><tt>HardwareFault</tt> A physical I/O error has occurred.

--   <li><a>InappropriateType</a> The path refers to an existing
--   non-directory object. <tt>[ENOTDIR]</tt></li>
--   </ul>
listDirectory :: FilePath -> IO [FilePath]

-- | Similar to <a>listDirectory</a>, but always includes the special
--   entries (<tt>.</tt> and <tt>..</tt>). (This applies to Windows as
--   well.)
--   
--   The operation may fail with the same exceptions as
--   <a>listDirectory</a>.
getDirectoryContents :: FilePath -> IO [FilePath]

-- | Obtain the current working directory as an absolute path.
--   
--   In a multithreaded program, the current working directory is a global
--   state shared among all threads of the process. Therefore, when
--   performing filesystem operations from multiple threads, it is highly
--   recommended to use absolute rather than relative paths (see:
--   <a>makeAbsolute</a>).
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><tt>HardwareFault</tt> A physical I/O error has occurred.
--   <tt>[EIO]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>isDoesNotExistError</a> or <tt>NoSuchThing</tt> There is no
--   path referring to the working directory. <tt>[EPERM, ENOENT,
--   ESTALE...]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>isPermissionError</a> or <tt>PermissionDenied</tt> The process
--   has insufficient privileges to perform the operation.
--   <tt>[EACCES]</tt></li>

--   perform the operation.</li>
--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The operating system has no notion of
--   current working directory.</li>
--   </ul>
getCurrentDirectory :: IO FilePath

-- | Change the working directory to the given path.
--   
--   In a multithreaded program, the current working directory is a global
--   state shared among all threads of the process. Therefore, when
--   performing filesystem operations from multiple threads, it is highly
--   recommended to use absolute rather than relative paths (see:
--   <a>makeAbsolute</a>).
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><tt>HardwareFault</tt> A physical I/O error has occurred.
--   <tt>[EIO]</tt></li>
--   <li><tt>InvalidArgument</tt> The operand is not a valid directory

--   has insufficient privileges to perform the operation.
--   <tt>[EACCES]</tt></li>
--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The operating system has no notion of

--   <li><a>InappropriateType</a> The path refers to an existing
--   non-directory object. <tt>[ENOTDIR]</tt></li>
--   </ul>
setCurrentDirectory :: FilePath -> IO ()

-- | Run an <a>IO</a> action with the given working directory and restore
--   the original working directory afterwards, even if the given action
--   fails due to an exception.
--   
--   The operation may fail with the same exceptions as
--   <a>getCurrentDirectory</a> and <a>setCurrentDirectory</a>.
withCurrentDirectory :: FilePath -> IO a -> IO a

-- | Returns the current user's home directory.
--   
--   The directory returned is expected to be writable by the current user,
--   but note that it isn't generally considered good practice to store
--   application-specific data here; use <a>getXdgDirectory</a> or
--   <a>getAppUserDataDirectory</a> instead.
--   
--   On Unix, <a>getHomeDirectory</a> returns the value of the
--   <tt>HOME</tt> environment variable. On Windows, the system is queried
--   for a suitable path; a typical path might be
--   <tt>C:/Users/<i>&lt;user&gt;</i></tt>.
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The operating system has no notion of

--   <li><a>isDoesNotExistError</a> The home directory for the current user
--   does not exist, or cannot be found.</li>
--   </ul>
getHomeDirectory :: IO FilePath

-- | Special directories for storing user-specific application data,
--   configuration, and cache files, as specified by the <a>XDG Base
--   Directory Specification</a>.
--   
--   Note: On Windows, <a>XdgData</a> and <a>XdgConfig</a> map to the same
--   directory.
data XdgDirectory

-- | For data files (e.g. images). Defaults to <tt>~/.local/share</tt> and
--   can be overridden by the <tt>XDG_DATA_HOME</tt> environment variable.
--   On Windows, it is <tt>%APPDATA%</tt> (e.g.
--   <tt>C:/Users/<i>&lt;user&gt;</i>/AppData/Roaming</tt>). Can be
--   considered as the user-specific equivalent of <tt>/usr/share</tt>.
XdgData :: XdgDirectory

-- | For configuration files. Defaults to <tt>~/.config</tt> and can be
--   overridden by the <tt>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</tt> environment variable. On
--   Windows, it is <tt>%APPDATA%</tt> (e.g.
--   <tt>C:/Users/<i>&lt;user&gt;</i>/AppData/Roaming</tt>). Can be
--   considered as the user-specific equivalent of <tt>/etc</tt>.
XdgConfig :: XdgDirectory

-- | For non-essential files (e.g. cache). Defaults to <tt>~/.cache</tt>
--   and can be overridden by the <tt>XDG_CACHE_HOME</tt> environment
--   variable. On Windows, it is <tt>%LOCALAPPDATA%</tt> (e.g.
--   <tt>C:/Users/<i>&lt;user&gt;</i>/AppData/Local</tt>). Can be
--   considered as the user-specific equivalent of <tt>/var/cache</tt>.
XdgCache :: XdgDirectory

-- | Obtain the paths to special directories for storing user-specific
--   application data, configuration, and cache files, conforming to the
--   <a>XDG Base Directory Specification</a>. Compared with
--   <a>getAppUserDataDirectory</a>, this function provides a more
--   fine-grained hierarchy as well as greater flexibility for the user.
--   
--   It also works on Windows, although in that case <a>XdgData</a> and
--   <a>XdgConfig</a> will map to the same directory.
--   
--   The second argument is usually the name of the application. Since it
--   will be integrated into the path, it must consist of valid path
--   characters.
--   
--   Note: The directory may not actually exist, in which case you would
--   need to create it with file mode <tt>700</tt> (i.e. only accessible by
--   the owner).
getXdgDirectory :: XdgDirectory -> FilePath -> IO FilePath

-- | Obtain the path to a special directory for storing user-specific
--   application data (traditional Unix location). Newer applications may
--   prefer the the XDG-conformant location provided by
--   <a>getXdgDirectory</a> (<a>migration guide</a>).
--   
--   The argument is usually the name of the application. Since it will be
--   integrated into the path, it must consist of valid path characters.
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>On Unix-like systems, the path is
--   <tt>~/.<i>&lt;app&gt;</i></tt>.</li>
--   <li>On Windows, the path is <tt>%APPDATA%/<i>&lt;app&gt;</i></tt>
--   (e.g.
--   <tt>C:/Users/<i>&lt;user&gt;</i>/AppData/Roaming/<i>&lt;app&gt;</i></tt>)</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   Note: the directory may not actually exist, in which case you would
--   need to create it. It is expected that the parent directory exists and
--   is writable.
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The operating system has no notion of
--   application-specific data directory.</li>
--   <li><a>isDoesNotExistError</a> The home directory for the current user
--   does not exist, or cannot be found.</li>
--   </ul>
getAppUserDataDirectory :: FilePath -> IO FilePath

-- | Returns the current user's document directory.
--   
--   The directory returned is expected to be writable by the current user,
--   but note that it isn't generally considered good practice to store
--   application-specific data here; use <a>getXdgDirectory</a> or
--   <a>getAppUserDataDirectory</a> instead.
--   
--   On Unix, <a>getUserDocumentsDirectory</a> returns the value of the
--   <tt>HOME</tt> environment variable. On Windows, the system is queried
--   for a suitable path; a typical path might be
--   <tt>C:/Users/<i>&lt;user&gt;</i>/Documents</tt>.
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The operating system has no notion of
--   document directory.</li>
--   <li><a>isDoesNotExistError</a> The document directory for the current
--   user does not exist, or cannot be found.</li>
--   </ul>
getUserDocumentsDirectory :: IO FilePath

-- | Returns the current directory for temporary files.
--   
--   On Unix, <a>getTemporaryDirectory</a> returns the value of the
--   <tt>TMPDIR</tt> environment variable or "/tmp" if the variable isn't
--   defined. On Windows, the function checks for the existence of
--   environment variables in the following order and uses the first path
--   found:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>TMP environment variable.</li>
--   <li>TEMP environment variable.</li>
--   <li>USERPROFILE environment variable.</li>
--   <li>The Windows directory</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   The operation may fail with:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>UnsupportedOperation</a> The operating system has no notion of
--   temporary directory.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   The function doesn't verify whether the path exists.
getTemporaryDirectory :: IO FilePath

-- | <a>removeFile</a> <i>file</i> removes the directory entry for an
--   existing file <i>file</i>, where <i>file</i> is not itself a
--   directory. The implementation may specify additional constraints which
--   must be satisfied before a file can be removed (e.g. the file may not

removeFile :: FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt><a>renameFile</a> old new</tt> changes the name of an existing

renamePath :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

-- | Copy a file with its permissions. If the destination file already
--   exists, it is replaced atomically. Neither path may refer to an
--   existing directory. No exceptions are thrown if the permissions could
--   not be copied.
copyFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

-- | Copy a file with its associated metadata. If the destination file
--   already exists, it is overwritten. There is no guarantee of atomicity
--   in the replacement of the destination file. Neither path may refer to
--   an existing directory. If the source and/or destination are symbolic
--   links, the copy is performed on the targets of the links.
--   
--   On Windows, it behaves like the Win32 function <a>CopyFile</a>, which
--   copies various kinds of metadata including file attributes and
--   security resource properties.
--   
--   On Unix-like systems, permissions, access time, and modification time
--   are preserved. If possible, the owner and group are also preserved.
--   Note that the very act of copying can change the access time of the
--   source file, hence the access times of the two files may differ after
--   the operation completes.
copyFileWithMetadata :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

-- | Make a path absolute, <a>normalise</a> the path, and remove as many
--   indirections from it as possible. Any trailing path separators are
--   discarded via <a>dropTrailingPathSeparator</a>. Additionally, on
--   Windows the letter case of the path is canonicalized.
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: This function is a very big hammer. If you only need an
--   absolute path, <a>makeAbsolute</a> is sufficient for removing
--   dependence on the current working directory.
--   
--   Indirections include the two special directories <tt>.</tt> and
--   <tt>..</tt>, as well as any symbolic links. The input path need not
--   point to an existing file or directory. Canonicalization is performed
--   on the longest prefix of the path that points to an existing file or
--   directory. The remaining portion of the path that does not point to an
--   existing file or directory will still undergo <a>normalise</a>, but
--   case canonicalization and indirection removal are skipped as they are
--   impossible to do on a nonexistent path.
--   
--   Most programs should not worry about the canonicity of a path. In
--   particular, despite the name, the function does not truly guarantee
--   canonicity of the returned path due to the presence of hard links,
--   mount points, etc.
--   
--   If the path points to an existing file or directory, then the output
--   path shall also point to the same file or directory, subject to the
--   condition that the relevant parts of the file system do not change
--   while the function is still running. In other words, the function is
--   definitively not atomic. The results can be utterly wrong if the
--   portions of the path change while this function is running.
--   
--   Since symbolic links (and, on non-Windows systems, parent directories
--   <tt>..</tt>) are dependent on the state of the existing filesystem,
--   the function can only make a conservative attempt by removing such
--   indirections from the longest prefix of the path that still points to
--   an existing file or directory.
--   
--   Note that on Windows parent directories <tt>..</tt> are always fully
--   expanded before the symbolic links, as consistent with the rest of the
--   Windows API (such as <tt>GetFullPathName</tt>). In contrast, on POSIX
--   systems parent directories <tt>..</tt> are expanded alongside symbolic
--   links from left to right. To put this more concretely: if <tt>L</tt>
--   is a symbolic link for <tt>R/P</tt>, then on Windows <tt>L\..</tt>
--   refers to <tt>.</tt>, whereas on other operating systems <tt>L/..</tt>
--   refers to <tt>R</tt>.
--   
--   Similar to <a>normalise</a>, passing an empty path is equivalent to
--   passing the current directory.
--   
--   <i>Known bugs</i>: When the path contains an existing symbolic link,
--   but the target of the link does not exist, then the path is not
--   dereferenced (bug #64). Symbolic link expansion is not performed on
--   Windows XP or earlier due to the absence of
--   <tt>GetFinalPathNameByHandle</tt>.
--   
--   <i>Changes since 1.2.3.0:</i> The function has been altered to be more
--   robust and has the same exception behavior as <a>makeAbsolute</a>.
--   
--   <i>Changes since 1.3.0.0:</i> The function no longer preserves the
--   trailing path separator. File symbolic links that appear in the middle
--   of a path are properly dereferenced. Case canonicalization and
--   symbolic link expansion are now performed on Windows.
canonicalizePath :: FilePath -> IO FilePath

-- | Convert a path into an absolute path. If the given path is relative,
--   the current directory is prepended and then the combined result is
--   <a>normalise</a>d. If the path is already absolute, the path is simply
--   <a>normalise</a>d. The function preserves the presence or absence of
--   the trailing path separator unless the path refers to the root
--   directory <tt>/</tt>.
--   
--   If the path is already absolute, the operation never fails. Otherwise,
--   the operation may fail with the same exceptions as
--   <a>getCurrentDirectory</a>.
makeAbsolute :: FilePath -> IO FilePath

-- | Construct a path relative to the current directory, similar to
--   <a>makeRelative</a>.
--   
--   The operation may fail with the same exceptions as
--   <a>getCurrentDirectory</a>.
makeRelativeToCurrentDirectory :: FilePath -> IO FilePath

-- | Given an executable file name, searches for such file in the
--   directories listed in system PATH. The returned value is the path to
--   the found executable or Nothing if an executable with the given name
--   was not found. For example (findExecutable "ghc") gives you the path
--   to GHC.
--   
--   The path returned by <a>findExecutable</a> corresponds to the program
--   that would be executed by <a>createProcess</a> when passed the same
--   string (as a RawCommand, not a ShellCommand).
--   
--   On Windows, <a>findExecutable</a> calls the Win32 function
--   <tt>SearchPath</tt>, which may search other places before checking the
--   directories in <tt>PATH</tt>. Where it actually searches depends on
--   registry settings, but notably includes the directory containing the
--   current executable. See
--   <a>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365527.aspx</a> for more
--   details.
findExecutable :: String -> IO (Maybe FilePath)

-- | Given a file name, searches for the file and returns a list of all
--   occurences that are executable.
--   
--   On Windows, this only returns the first ocurrence, if any. It uses the
--   <tt>SearchPath</tt> from the Win32 API, so the caveats noted in
--   <a>findExecutable</a> apply here as well.
findExecutables :: String -> IO [FilePath]

-- | Given a file name, searches for the file on the given paths and
--   returns a list of all occurences that are executable.
findExecutablesInDirectories :: [FilePath] -> String -> IO [FilePath]

-- | Search through the given set of directories for the given file.
findFile :: [FilePath] -> String -> IO (Maybe FilePath)

-- | Search through the given set of directories for the given file and
--   returns a list of paths where the given file exists.
findFiles :: [FilePath] -> String -> IO [FilePath]

-- | Search through the given set of directories for the given file and
--   with the given property (usually permissions) and returns the file
--   path where the given file exists and has the property.
findFileWith :: (FilePath -> IO Bool) -> [FilePath] -> String -> IO (Maybe FilePath)

-- | Search through the given set of directories for the given file and
--   with the given property (usually permissions) and returns a list of
--   paths where the given file exists and has the property.
findFilesWith :: (FilePath -> IO Bool) -> [FilePath] -> String -> IO [FilePath]

-- | Filename extension for executable files (including the dot if any)
--   (usually <tt>""</tt> on POSIX systems and <tt>".exe"</tt> on Windows
--   or OS/2).
exeExtension :: String

-- | Obtain the size of a file in bytes.
getFileSize :: FilePath -> IO Integer

-- | Test whether the given path points to an existing filesystem object.
--   If the user lacks necessary permissions to search the parent
--   directories, this function may return false even if the file does
--   actually exist.
doesPathExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool

-- | The operation <a>doesFileExist</a> returns <a>True</a> if the argument
--   file exists and is not a directory, and <a>False</a> otherwise.
doesFileExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool

-- | The operation <a>doesDirectoryExist</a> returns <a>True</a> if the
--   argument file exists and is either a directory or a symbolic link to a
--   directory, and <a>False</a> otherwise.
doesDirectoryExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool

-- | Check whether the path refers to a symbolic link. On Windows, this
--   tests for <tt>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT</tt>.
